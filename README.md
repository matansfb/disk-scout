# DiskScout – Storage Price Comparison Tool

DiskScout is a small tool built to compare SSD, NVMe and HDD prices across Amazon.

## Why?
Tracking storage prices manually across multiple listings is painful,
especially when planning PC builds or NAS upgrades.

## What it does
- Compares SSD / NVMe / HDD prices
- Focuses on storage only (no GPUs / CPUs)
- Updates prices automatically
