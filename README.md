# DiskScout – Storage Price Comparison Tool

DiskScout is a small web tool that compares SSD, NVMe and HDD prices across Amazon.

## The problem
When building or upgrading a PC (or planning a NAS),
tracking storage prices manually across multiple Amazon listings is painful
and time-consuming.

## What DiskScout does
- Compares SSD / NVMe / HDD prices across Amazon
- Focuses on storage only (no GPUs or CPUs)
- Updates prices automatically
- Helps find better storage deals faster
